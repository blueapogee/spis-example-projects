Description of the spis project:
Typical spacecraft in GEOsynchronous orbit with plasma environment worst-case of ECSS-E10-04A. The Cad was described in "J.-F. Roussel, G. Dufour, J.-C. Mateo-Velez, B. Thiébault, B. Andersson, D. Rodgers, A. Hilgers, D. Payan, SPIS multi time scale and multi physics capabilities: development and application to GEO charging and flashover modelling, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci., Vol 40, N°2, 2012".
Specifically, in this project:
- The spacecraft is conductive (alox or CFRP) except solar panel front side (solar cell cover glass material).
- The exit from eclipse is simulated at t = 1000 s, with progressive photocurrent and dielectric conductivity evolution to mimic temperature effects.


For information: the simulation run in approximately 75 minutes in the ONERA/DESP server Auriga (Dell PowerEdge R820, 32 available cores, 192 Go of RAM, 5.4 To), with particle pushing on 4 threads.
